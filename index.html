		<h1>Parker's Portfolio</h1>

		<h2>About</h2>

		<p>My name is M. Parker Posey and I am a freshman studying
		philosophy but with interest in computer science and how
		I can use it in my future career or hobbies!</p>

		<h2>Projects</h2>

		<p>Three projects that I have worked on are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Password generator</li>
			<li>Message encrypter and decrypter</li>
			<li>Hotplate heat transfer simulation</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<h3>BYU CSC</h3>

		<p>I am currently employed at the BYU CSC as both a Cook Chill
		worker and a Dairy Production worker. I make different soups 
		and sauces as well as heat and freeze other products to be
		delivered around campus. I also assist in packaging many 
		different ice cream flavors. </p>

		<h3>TJ Maxx</h3>

		<p>I was a seasonal employee at TJ Maxx two years ago where
		I worked as retail and customer service on my assigned
		area of the floor which I was expected to maintain and organize
		in a presentable manner.</p>
