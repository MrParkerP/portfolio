  		<h2 id="about">About</h2>

  		<p>My name is M. Parker Posey and I am a freshman studying
  		philosophy but with interest in computer science and how
  		I can use it in my future career or hobbies!</p>

  		<h2 id="experiences">Experience</h2>
  		<h3>BYU CSC</h3>

  		<p>I am currently employed at the BYU CSC as both a Cook Chill
  		worker and a Dairy Production worker. I make different soups
  		and sauces as well as heat and freeze other products to be
  		delivered around campus. I also assist in packaging many
  		different ice cream flavors. </p>

  		<h3>TJ Maxx</h3>

  		<p>I was a seasonal employee at TJ Maxx two years ago where
  		I worked as retail and customer service on my assigned
  		area of the floor which I was expected to maintain and organize
  		in a presentable manner.</p>
